#### [1.0.0](https://github.com/halturin/ergo/releases/tag/1.0.0) - 2019-11-30 ####
There is a bunch of changes we deliver with this release
- We have changed the name - Ergo (or Ergo Framework). GitHub's repo has been renamed as well. We also have created cloned repo `ergonode` to support users of the old version of this project. So, its still available at [https://github.com/halturin/ergonode](https://github.com/halturin/ergonode). But it's strongly recommend to use the new one.
- Completely reworked (almost from scratch) architecture whole project
- Implemented linking process feature (in order to support Application/Supervisor behaviors)
- Reworked Monitor-feature. Now it has full-featured support with remote process/nodes
- Added multinode support
- Added basic observer support
- Improved code structure and readability
- Among the new features we have added new bugs that still uncovered :). So, any feedback/bugreport/contribution is highly appreciated

#### [0.2.0](https://github.com/halturin/ergonode/releases/tag/0.2.0) - 2019-02-23 ####
- Now we make versioning releases
- Improve node creation. Now you can specify the listening port range. See 'Usage' for details
- Add embedded EPMD. Trying to start internal epmd service on starting ergonode.
